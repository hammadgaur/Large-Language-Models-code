      "Q: What is the average attendance percentage across all modules?\n",
      "A: To find the average attendance percentage across all modules, we first sum all the attendance percentages and then divide by the total number of modules (students in this case). Let's calculate:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ethan Carter: 50%\n",
      "- Olivia Bennett: 40%\n",
      "- Mason Brooks: 80%\n",
      "- Ava Turner: 70%\n",
      "- Noah Griffin: 20%\n",
      "- Emily Ford: 45%\n",
      "- Jacob Morris: 86%\n",
      "- Lily Hughes: 89%\n",
      "- Lucas Murphy: 100%\n",
      "- Sophia Perry: 49%\n",
      "\n",
      "Total Attendance Percentage = 50% + 40% + 80% + 70% + 20% + 45% + 86% + 89% + 100% + 49% = 629%\n",
      "\n",
      "Number of Modules (or students) = 10\n",
      "\n",
      "Average Attendance Percentage = (Total Attendance Percentage) / (Number of Modules) = 629% / 10 = 62.9%\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the average attendance percentage across all modules is 62.9%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Which student has the highest attendance percentage?\n",
      "A: Lucas Murphy has the highest attendance percentage with 100%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Are there any modules with particularly high or low attendance rates?\n",
      "A: Yes, there are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **High Attendance Rates:**\n",
      "  - Jacob Morris's enrollment in \"Cryptozoology and Unseen Fauna\" has a very high attendance rate of 86%.\n",
      "  - Lily Hughes's participation in \"Mystical Cartography\" also shows a high attendance rate of 89%.\n",
      "  - Lucas Murphy's attendance in \"Cybernetic Ethics\" stands out with a perfect attendance rate of 100%.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Low Attendance Rates:**\n",
      "  - Noah Griffin's attendance in \"Elemental Culinary Arts\" is remarkably low, at only 20%.\n",
      "  - Olivia Bennett's attendance in \"Advanced Thaumaturgy\" is also on the lower side, at 40%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Can you summarize the overall feedback for the \"Temporal Paradox Management\" module?\n",
      "A: The overall feedback for the \"Temporal Paradox Management\" module, as provided by Ava Turner, suggests that the course was too theoretical with little to no practical application. The student questioned the real-world applicability of the content, implying a desire for more practical examples or applications that could relate to situations where the knowledge gained from the course could be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Are there any common themes in the feedback for modules with low attendance?\n",
      "A: Yes, for modules with low attendance, there are some common themes in the feedback:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Practical vs. Theoretical**: Students seem to appreciate practical sessions more than theoretical ones. For instance, Olivia Bennett mentioned that the practical sessions were her favorite part of \"Advanced Thaumaturgy,\" despite her overall attendance being just 40%. On the contrary, Ava Turner, with a 70% attendance in \"Temporal Paradox Management,\" criticized the course for being too theoretical.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expectation vs. Reality**: Some students indicated that the courses did not meet their expectations in terms of content. For example, Lily Hughes expected \"Mystical Cartography\" to have more historical content rather than the creation of imaginary maps, despite having high attendance (89%). Ethan Carter's feedback on \"Quantum Mythology,\" with a 50% attendance, suggests that the lectures felt detached from reality, indicating a misalignment between student expectations and the course content.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Content Relevance**: These comments also highlight concerns about the relevance of courses to studentsâ€™ interests or perceived future needs. Ava Turner questioned the practical applicability of \"Temporal Paradox Management,\" and Lucas Murphy, although having 100% attendance in \"Cybernetic Ethics,\" raised concerns about the philosophical focus over the technical aspects of cybernetic technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "In sum, themes of preferring practical learning experiences over purely theoretical ones, courses not meeting expectations in terms of content and historical vs. imaginative focus, and concerns regarding the relevance of course content to future practical applications appear common among modules with varying levels of attendance, but are particularly resonant in reflections on courses with lower engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Does student engagement (as measured by attendance and feedback) vary significantly between different modules?\n",
      "A: From the provided data, we can observe variations in student engagement across different modules, where engagement is measured by attendance percentage and the nature of the feedback provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Quantum Mythology (Ethan Carter, 50% attendance)**: The feedback indicates a level of disengagement or dissatisfaction, possibly explaining the moderate attendance rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Advanced Thaumaturgy (Olivia Bennett, 40% attendance)**: Despite the lower attendance rate, the feedback is highly positive, suggesting that the content was engaging for the student, but some external factors might have impacted attendance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Galactic Horticulture (Mason Brooks, 80% attendance)**: The struggle with Earth-based references didn't deter a high attendance rate, indicating a commitment to the module despite the challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Temporal Paradox Management (Ava Turner, 70% attendance)**: The feedback reveals dissatisfaction with the course's practical applicability, which might still reflect a relatively high engagement level as seen in the attendance rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Elemental Culinary Arts (Noah Griffin, 20% attendance)**: The low attendance contrasts with the positive feedback, suggesting external factors may influence attendance.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Interstellar Linguistics (Emily Ford, 45% attendance)**: The feedback and moderate attendance together hint at mixed feelings about the course content, indicating varied engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Cryptozoology and Unseen Fauna (Jacob Morris, 86% attendance)**: High attendance and positive feedback show strong engagement with the course.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Mystical Cartography (Lily Hughes, 89% attendance)**: Despite the feedback indicating a mismatch in expectations, the high attendance suggests a strong commitment to participating in the module.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Cybernetic Ethics (Lucas Murphy, 100% attendance)**: The highest attendance paired with critical feedback suggests highly committed engagement, albeit with expectations for more technologically focused content.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Arcane Economics (Sophia Perry, 49% attendance)**: The feedback is positive, but the moderate attendance rate indicates that factors other than the course content might influence engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the data shows significant variability in how students engage with different modules. While attendance rates provide a partial measure of engagement, they don't always align with the sentiment expressed in feedback. For instance, some students with lower attendance rates provided positive feedback, suggesting that factors outside the course content impact engagement. Conversely, high attendance does not always correlate with satisfaction, as seen in the case of \"Cybernetic Ethics.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These disparities suggest that student engagement is multi-faceted and cannot be fully understood by looking at attendance percentages and feedback in isolation. External factors, personal interests, course expectations, and course delivery might all play roles in influencing engagement levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Can you create a pie-chart of percentage of attendance?\n",
      "A: I'm unable to directly create or display visuals like pie charts here. However, I can guide you on how to create a pie chart to represent the attendance percentages for the students listed using a tool or programming language like Python with libraries such as Matplotlib or Pandas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a step-by-step guide to create a pie chart using Python, assuming you already have the data in a file or a data structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Set up your environment:**\n",
      "   First, ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You'll also need Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for plotting the chart. You can install these packages using pip if you haven't already:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   pip install pandas matplotlib\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Prepare your script:**\n",
      "   Next, create a Python script or a Jupyter Notebook. Load your data into a pandas DataFrame. If your data is in a CSV file, you can use `pandas.read_csv()` to load it. Here's a basic structure of how your code might look, assuming the data is already in a variable:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   import pandas as pd\n",
      "   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
      "\n",
      "   # Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame containing the data\n",
      "   # If loading from a CSV, use data = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\n",
      "\n",
      "   # Convert attendance percentages from strings to integers\n",
      "   data['Attendence_Percetage'] = data['Attendence_Percetage'].str.rstrip('%').astype('int')\n",
      "\n",
      "   # Plotting the pie chart\n",
      "   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\n",
      "   plt.pie(data['Attendence_Percetage'], labels=data['Students_Name'], autopct='%1.1f%%')\n",
      "   plt.title('Attendance Percentage')\n",
      "   plt.show()\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Adjust the code as necessary:**\n",
      "    If your data source differs or you wish to customize the chart (e.g., change colors, explode a slice, etc.), you'll need to modify the code accordingly. Matplotlib's documentation is a great resource for customization options.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Run your script:**\n",
      "   Execute your script in your Python environment. The pie chart should display, showing the distribution of attendance percentages for each student.\n",
      "\n",
      "This guide assumes a moderate familiarity with Python. If you're using another tool or software to create your pie chart, the general approach would be similar: load or input your data, select the pie chart option, and map your data to the correct axes.\n",
